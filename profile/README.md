The segment-boneyard organization houses repositories that were once in use by [Segment](https://github.com/segmentio/) but are no longer. Instead of destroying an old repository, it is moved here.

**You are strongly discouraged from using any repositories in this organization.** A repository placed here is dead and should not be used. However, feel free to pick over its bones for historical information or snippets to resurrect into new codebases.
